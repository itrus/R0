Estimation of basic reproduction number (R0) in animal trials using R.

Attack rate (AR; Obadia et al., 2012), Martingale (MA; Bouma et al., 1997) and Final size (FS; De Jong and Kimman, 1994) methods are available in R0-AR_MA_FS.R.

Final size method using two similar (repeated) experiments are available in R0-FSx2.R.

Generalized linear model (GLM; Claes et al., 2013) is available in R0-GLM.R.

All the abovementioned methods are well reviewed by Velthuis et al. (2007).
